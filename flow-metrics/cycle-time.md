# Cycle Time (Flow Efficiency Standard)

## Purpose
Cycle Time measures how long it takes for a work item to move from **start of active work** to **completion**. It is a primary indicator of delivery speed, flow efficiency, and system health in Agile and Lean environments.

Cycle Time focuses on **how fast value flows**, not how busy teams are.

---

## Definition
**Cycle Time = Finish Date − Start Date**

- **Start Date**: When work begins (e.g., In Progress)
- **Finish Date**: When work meets Definition of Done

Cycle Time is measured **per work item** and analyzed as a trend over time.

---

## Why Cycle Time Matters
- Improves predictability of delivery
- Exposes bottlenecks and delays
- Enables realistic forecasting
- Reduces Work in Progress (WIP)
- Supports continuous improvement decisions

Lower and more stable Cycle Time indicates a healthier delivery system.

---

## Measurement Guidelines
- Track Cycle Time at the **story or work-item level**
- Use **median and percentile values** (not averages)
- Analyze trends over multiple sprints
- Segment by work type if needed (features, defects, tech debt)

Recommended percentiles:
- **50th percentile (median)** – typical delivery speed
- **85th percentile** – commitment confidence
- **95th percentile** – risk and outliers

---

## Interpretation
- **Decreasing Cycle Time** → Improved flow and reduced delays
- **Increasing Cycle Time** → Bottlenecks, overcommitment, or dependencies
- **High variance** → Unstable intake, unclear requirements, or interruptions

Cycle Time should be **predictable before it is fast**.

---

## Good Practices
- Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
- Slice work into small, vertical increments
- Enforce Definition of Ready before starting work
- Remove blockers quickly
- Visualize flow using cumulative flow diagrams

---

## Common Mistakes
- Comparing Cycle Time across teams without context
- Using averages instead of percentiles
- Treating Cycle Time as a performance metric for individuals
- Ignoring aging work items
- Optimizing speed at the expense of quality

---

## Relationship to Other Metrics
- **Lead Time**: From request to completion (broader view)
- **Throughput**: How many items are completed
- **WIP**: Directly impacts Cycle Time
- **Predictability**: Stabilized by consistent Cycle Time

Cycle Time is most effective when analyzed alongside WIP and Throughput.

## Guiding Principle
> Do not ask teams to go faster.  
> Improve the system so work flows faster naturally.
