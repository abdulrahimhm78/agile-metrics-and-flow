# Cycle Time (Flow Efficiency)

## What It Is
Cycle time measures how long it takes
for a work item to move from start
to completion.

## Why It Matters
Cycle time highlights bottlenecks
and delays within the delivery process.

## How to Use It
- Measure average and trend over time
- Identify stages where work stalls
- Use it to improve flow, not pressure teams

## Common Misuse
- Treating cycle time as a performance target
- Comparing cycle time across teams
- Expecting immediate improvements
