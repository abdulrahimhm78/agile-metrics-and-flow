# Throughput (Delivery Volume)

## What It Is
Throughput measures the number of work items
completed over a given period of time.

## Why It Matters
Throughput helps teams understand delivery
capacity and trends without relying on estimates.

## How to Use It
- Track completed items per sprint or week
- Observe trends over time, not single data points
- Use it to support forecasting conversations

## Common Misuse
- Comparing throughput between teams
- Using throughput as a performance metric
- Expecting constant throughput every sprint
