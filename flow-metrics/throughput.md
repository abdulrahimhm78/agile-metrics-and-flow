# Throughput (Flow Metric)

## Purpose
Throughput measures the number of work items completed per unit of time. It is a core flow metric used to assess delivery capacity, system performance, and predictability at team, program, and portfolio levels.

## Definition
**Throughput** = Count of completed work items (meeting Definition of Done) within a defined time period (e.g., per sprint, per week, per PI).

Throughput focuses on **finished work**, not effort, hours, or story points.

## Why Throughput Matters
- Enables data-driven forecasting and planning
- Reveals true delivery capacity over time
- Supports flow-based decision-making
- Reduces reliance on subjective estimates
- Highlights system constraints and bottlenecks

## Measurement Standards
- Count only items that meet **Definition of Done**
- Use consistent work item types (e.g., stories only, or stories + defects)
- Measure over consistent time intervals
- Exclude partially completed or carried-over work

## Recommended Cadence
- **Team level:** Sprint-by-sprint
- **Program level:** Iteration aggregation
- **Portfolio level:** Monthly or quarterly trend analysis

## Interpretation Guidelines
- Stable throughput indicates a healthy, predictable system
- Increasing throughput suggests improved flow or reduced constraints
- Decreasing throughput signals capacity loss, increased WIP, or systemic blockers
- Throughput should be analyzed alongside Cycle Time and WIP

## Good Practices
- Track trends, not single data points
- Use rolling averages for forecasting
- Pair throughput with work item aging analysis
- Review throughput changes during retrospectives
- Use throughput to inform capacity-based planning

## Common Misuse to Avoid
- Comparing throughput across teams with different work types
- Using throughput as a performance target for individuals
- Inflating throughput by splitting work unnaturally
- Mixing unrelated work item types without normalization

## Executive View
At scale, throughput provides leadership with:
- Predictable delivery forecasts
- Evidence-based capacity discussions
- Early signals of systemic delivery risk
- Objective input for prioritization decisions

## Guiding Principle
Optimize the system for **steady, sustainable throughput**, not short-term output spikes.
