# Flow Metrics (Delivery Health & Predictability)

Flow Metrics provide objective, outcome-focused visibility into how work moves through the system. They are used to assess delivery health, identify constraints, and enable predictable execution at team, program, and portfolio levels.

---

## Purpose

To enable data-driven decision-making by measuring the efficiency, stability, and predictability of delivery flow across teams and value streams.

---

## Core Flow Metrics

### 1. Flow Velocity
**What it measures:**  
The amount of work completed over a given time period.

**Typical units:**  
- Story points
- Work items
- Features / Enablers (at program level)

**Why it matters:**  
- Indicates delivery capacity
- Supports forecasting and planning
- Trends matter more than absolute values

---

### 2. Flow Time (Cycle Time)
**What it measures:**  
The elapsed time from when work starts to when it is completed.

**Includes:**  
- Active work time  
- Wait time  
- Handoffs and dependencies  

**Why it matters:**  
- Shorter flow time = faster value delivery  
- Highlights bottlenecks and delays  
- Improves stakeholder confidence through predictability  

---

### 3. Flow Efficiency
**What it measures:**  
The ratio of active work time to total elapsed time.

**Formula:**  
Flow Efficiency = (Active Work Time / Total Flow Time) × 100

**Why it matters:**  
- Exposes waste and wait states  
- Low efficiency signals dependency, queueing, or prioritization issues  

---

### 4. Flow Load (Work in Progress – WIP)
**What it measures:**  
The number of items currently in progress.

**Why it matters:**  
- High WIP increases context switching and delays  
- Controlled WIP improves throughput and quality  
- Enables faster feedback loops  

---

### 5. Flow Predictability
**What it measures:**  
The ratio of planned work completed versus work committed.

**Formula:**  
Flow Predictability = Completed Work / Planned Work

**Why it matters:**  
- Indicates planning realism  
- Builds trust with stakeholders  
- Supports stable delivery cadence

## How Metrics Are Used (and Not Used)

### Used For
- Identifying systemic bottlenecks
- Improving forecasting accuracy
- Supporting continuous improvement
- Informing leadership decisions
- Improving cross-team coordination

### Not Used For
- Individual performance evaluation
- Comparing teams competitively
- Micromanagement
- Enforcing fixed targets

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Optimizing velocity at the expense of quality
- Increasing WIP to “go faster”
- Using metrics as commitments instead of indicators
- Ignoring variability and context
- Focusing on single metrics in isolation

---

## Good Practices

- Track trends over time, not single data points
- Combine multiple flow metrics for context
- Visualize data using cumulative flow diagrams
- Review metrics regularly in retrospectives
- Tie metrics to improvement experiments

---

## Enterprise Guidance

- Flow Metrics should align with value streams, not org charts
- Program-level metrics should aggregate team-level data
- Leadership should focus on system health, not local optimization
- Metrics should be transparent and accessible

---

## Guiding Principle

> Improve the system of work, not the people doing the work.

Flow Metrics exist to make delivery predictable, sustainable, and continuously improving across the enterprise.
