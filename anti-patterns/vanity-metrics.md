# Vanity Metrics (Anti-Pattern)

## What They Are
Vanity metrics are measurements that
look impressive but do not provide
actionable insight into delivery health.

## Why They Are Harmful
Vanity metrics can create false confidence,
drive unhealthy behavior, and distract
from real delivery issues.

## Common Examples
- Story points used for performance evaluation
- Velocity comparisons across teams
- Raw utilization percentages

## Better Alternatives
- Flow metrics over time
- Trend-based analysis
- Context-aware delivery conversations
