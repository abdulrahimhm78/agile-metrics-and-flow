# Vanity Metrics (What to Avoid)

Vanity metrics create the illusion of progress without providing actionable insight into delivery health, value realization, or customer outcomes. In enterprise Agile environments, reliance on vanity metrics leads to poor decision-making, false confidence, and misaligned incentives.

This document defines common vanity metrics, why they are misleading, and what to use instead.

---

## Definition

**Vanity Metrics** are measurements that look positive on dashboards but do not meaningfully inform decisions, improve outcomes, or predict delivery success.

They often:
- Emphasize volume over value
- Reward activity instead of outcomes
- Mask systemic issues
- Encourage gaming behavior

---

## Common Vanity Metrics

### 1. Story Points Completed (in Isolation)
- High point totals do not indicate value delivery
- Inflated estimates distort comparisons
- Encourages point optimization over customer impact

**Use Instead**
- Sprint Goal success rate  
- Throughput trends  
- Cycle time stability  

---

### 2. Velocity Comparisons Across Teams
- Velocity is team-specific and non-transferable
- Cross-team comparisons create unhealthy pressure
- Leads to estimation manipulation

**Use Instead**
- Predictability (planned vs completed)  
- Delivery consistency over time  

---

### 3. Percent Utilization / Resource Efficiency
- High utilization reduces flow and adaptability
- Encourages overloading teams
- Increases burnout and defects

**Use Instead**
- Work in Progress (WIP) limits  
- Flow efficiency  
- Sustainable pace indicators  

---

### 4. Number of User Stories Delivered
- Story count varies by size and slicing quality
- Rewards breaking work unnaturally small
- Ignores outcome and quality

**Use Instead**
- Completed features or capabilities  
- Outcome-based acceptance criteria  
- Business objective progress  

---

### 5. On-Time Delivery (Without Scope Context)
- Hitting dates by cutting scope or quality
- Masks technical debt accumulation
- Promotes short-term wins over long-term health

**Use Instead**
- Value delivered vs planned  
- Quality metrics (defects, rework)  
- Dependency impact visibility  

---

### 6. Agile Maturity Scores
- Subjective and easily gamed
- Creates checklist compliance behavior
- Rarely correlates to delivery outcomes

**Use Instead**
- Observable behavior change  
- Improvement experiments completed  
- Measurable delivery improvements  

---

## Why Vanity Metrics Persist

- Executive pressure for simple numbers
- Dashboard-driven management culture
- Tool-default reporting
- Lack of outcome clarity

---

## Enterprise Guidance

- Metrics must drive **decisions**, not reporting
- Prefer **trends over snapshots**
- Tie metrics to **explicit questions**
- Review metrics regularly for relevance
- Eliminate metrics that do not change behavior

---

## Guiding Principle

> If a metric does not influence a decision, improve outcomes, or prompt corrective action, it should not be tracked.

---

## Recommended Companion Metrics

- Predictability
- Cycle time
- Throughput
- WIP
- Defect escape rate
- Dependency aging
- Business outcome progress

---

Vanity metrics should be explicitly identified, challenged, and removed to enable transparency, trust, and effective enterprise Agile delivery.
