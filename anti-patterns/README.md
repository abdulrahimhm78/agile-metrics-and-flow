# Agile & Scrum Anti-Patterns (Enterprise Context)

This document captures common anti-patterns observed in Scrum and Scaled Agile implementations that reduce flow, erode trust, and undermine predictable delivery. These patterns should be actively identified, challenged, and eliminated.

---

## Purpose

To create shared awareness of behaviors and practices that contradict Agile principles, enabling teams and leaders to course-correct early and sustain high-performing delivery.

---

## Team-Level Anti-Patterns

### 1. Status Reporting Disguised as Agile Events
**Description**
- Daily Scrum used to report status to the Scrum Master or manager.

**Impact**
- Loss of team ownership.
- Reduced collaboration and problem-solving.

**Correction**
- Re-focus Daily Scrum on progress toward the Sprint Goal and next 24-hour plan.

---

### 2. Commitment Without Capacity
**Description**
- Teams commit to work without accounting for PTO, support load, or technical debt.

**Impact**
- Chronic spillover and burnout.
- Erosion of trust in commitments.

**Correction**
- Enforce capacity-based planning and visible buffers.

---

### 3. Stories Without Clear Acceptance Criteria
**Description**
- Work enters sprint with vague requirements or undefined outcomes.

**Impact**
- Rework, delays, and subjective acceptance.

**Correction**
- Enforce Definition of Ready before sprint entry.

---

### 4. Retrospectives Without Action
**Description**
- Same issues raised every sprint with no follow-through.

**Impact**
- Team disengagement.
- Loss of credibility in continuous improvement.

**Correction**
- Limit action items, assign owners, and review outcomes each sprint.

---

## Scrum Master Anti-Patterns

### 5. Scrum Master as Project Manager
**Description**
- Assigning tasks, driving deadlines, or owning delivery outcomes.

**Impact**
- Reduced team autonomy.
- Dependency on the Scrum Master.

**Correction**
- Shift to coaching, facilitation, and system-level impediment removal.

---

### 6. Shielding the Team From Reality
**Description**
- Filtering or softening external pressure instead of enabling transparency.

**Impact**
- Misalignment with stakeholders.
- Surprise escalations.

**Correction**
- Enable healthy, transparent conversations with stakeholders.

---

## Product Owner / Product Management Anti-Patterns

### 7. Output Over Outcome
**Description**
- Measuring success by story count or velocity alone.

**Impact**
- Local optimization.
- Low business value delivery.

**Correction**
- Anchor backlog priorities to outcomes and value hypotheses.

---

### 8. Proxy Product Ownership Without Authority
**Description**
- Product Owner lacks decision-making power or availability.

**Impact**
- Delayed decisions.
- Frequent rework.

**Correction**
- Establish clear decision rights and empowered product ownership.

---

## Program / Leadership Anti-Patterns

### 9. Treating Agile as a Process, Not a Mindset
**Description**
- Mechanical adherence to ceremonies without cultural change.

**Impact**
- Agile theater.
- No real improvement in delivery.

**Correction**
- Reinforce Agile values through leadership behavior and incentives.

---

### 10. Hidden Dependencies
**Description**
- Cross-team dependencies discovered late or managed informally.

**Impact**
- Missed commitments.
- Firefighting during execution.

**Correction**
- Make dependencies visible early and manage them explicitly.

---

### 11. Fixed Scope, Fixed Date, Fixed Capacity
**Description**
- All constraints locked with no trade-off discussion.

**Impact**
- Quality erosion.
- Unsustainable delivery pace.

**Correction**
- Enable scope negotiation and economic prioritization.

---

## Metrics & Tooling Anti-Patterns

### 12. Velocity Used as a Performance Metric
**Description**
- Comparing teams or individuals using velocity.

**Impact**
- Gaming estimates.
- Loss of forecasting reliability.

**Correction**
- Use velocity for team-level forecasting only.

---

### 13. Tool-Centric Agility
**Description**
- Belief that Jira configuration equals Agile maturity.

**Impact**
- Process compliance without outcomes.

**Correction**
- Use tools to support conversations, not replace them.

---

## Guiding Principle

> If a practice reduces transparency, ownership, learning, or flow, it is an anti-pattern—regardless of how common or accepted it appears.

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Faster identification of systemic issues  
- Stronger team ownership and accountability  
- Improved delivery predictability and trust  

---

## Ownership

All roles—teams, Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and leaders—are accountable for identifying and correcting Agile anti-patterns.
