# Capacity Forecasting (Sustainable Planning)

## What It Is
Capacity forecasting estimates how much
work a team can realistically take on
based on availability and constraints.

## Why It Matters
Accurate capacity forecasting enables
realistic commitments and sustainable delivery.

## What to Consider
- Team availability (PTO, holidays)
- Production support and unplanned work
- Historical delivery patterns
- Known dependencies and risks

## Common Misuse
- Assuming 100% availability
- Ignoring support and interrupt work
- Using capacity to force commitments
