# Health & Quality (Delivery Quality Standard)

Execution quality and team health are leading indicators of sustainable delivery. This standard defines how teams measure, inspect, and continuously improve delivery health and product quality in enterprise Agile environments.

---

## Purpose

To ensure teams deliver **predictable, high-quality outcomes** while maintaining **sustainable pace, technical excellence, and psychological safety**.

---

## Scope

This standard applies across:
- Scrum and flow-based teams
- Program and portfolio delivery
- Regulated and non-regulated environments
- Product, platform, and data teams

---

## Health Dimensions

### 1. Delivery Health
Measures the team’s ability to plan, execute, and complete work predictably.

**Key Signals**
- Sprint goal achievement
- Commitment reliability
- Carryover trends
- Flow stability

**Healthy Indicators**
- Consistent sprint outcomes
- Minimal unplanned work
- Stable throughput over time

---

### 2. Quality Health
Measures whether work meets agreed quality and usability standards.

**Key Signals**
- Escaped defects
- Rework and defect aging
- Test automation coverage
- Definition of Done adherence

**Healthy Indicators**
- Low defect leakage
- Fast feedback cycles
- Work is “done-done” at sprint end

---

### 3. Technical Health
Measures sustainability of the codebase and delivery pipeline.

**Key Signals**
- Technical debt trend
- Build and deployment reliability
- Code review effectiveness
- Mean time to recover (MTTR)

**Healthy Indicators**
- Declining technical debt
- Automated, repeatable pipelines
- Fast and safe releases

---

### 4. Team Health
Measures engagement, safety, and collaboration.

**Key Signals**
- Team engagement
- Psychological safety
- Burnout indicators
- Collaboration effectiveness

**Healthy Indicators**
- Open communication
- Constructive retrospectives
- Sustainable pace without heroics

---

## Required Metrics (Balanced View)

Teams must inspect **all four dimensions**—not a single metric.

- Predictability (commitment vs completion)
- Cycle time and WIP
- Defect trends and rework
- Retrospective action follow-through
- Team sentiment (qualitative)

> Metrics are for **learning and improvement**, not performance management.

---

## Inspection Cadence

- **Daily:** Flow and blockers
- **Sprint Review:** Delivered value and quality
- **Retrospective:** Health signals and improvement actions
- **Quarterly:** Trend analysis across sprints or PIs

---

## Continuous Improvement Expectations

- Retrospectives produce **1–2 owned, testable actions**
- Health trends are visible and discussed
- Quality issues trigger systemic fixes, not workarounds
- Technical debt is addressed intentionally, not deferred indefinitely

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Optimizing for velocity at the expense of quality
- Ignoring team health signals until burnout occurs
- Treating quality as a QA responsibility
- Using metrics to compare or rank teams

---

## Guiding Principle

> **Fast delivery without quality is failure deferred.  
> Quality without sustainability is delivery at risk.**

Healthy teams deliver value predictably, safely, and continuously.
