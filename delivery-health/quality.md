# Quality (Delivery Stability)

## What It Is
Quality reflects the degree to which
delivered work meets agreed standards
without introducing defects or rework.

## Why It Matters
High quality reduces operational risk,
rework, and customer impact.

## How to Assess
- Defect trends over time
- Rework and spillover rates
- Production incident frequency

## Common Misuse
- Measuring quality only at the end
- Blaming teams instead of systems
- Optimizing speed at the expense of stability
