# Predictability (Delivery Reliability)

## What It Is
Predictability reflects how consistently
a team delivers on its commitments over time.

## Why It Matters
Predictable teams enable better planning,
stakeholder trust, and reduced delivery risk.

## How to Assess
- Planned vs completed work trends
- Stability of delivery outcomes
- Frequency of mid-sprint scope changes

## Common Misuse
- Expecting 100% predictability
- Penalizing teams for variability
- Ignoring context such as dependencies
