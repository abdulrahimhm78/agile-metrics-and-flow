# Predictability (Enterprise Delivery Predictability)

## Purpose
Predictability ensures that teams and programs consistently deliver what they commit to, when they commit to it, with acceptable quality. The goal is not rigid certainty, but **reliable forecasting, stable flow, and transparent trade-offs** at team, program, and portfolio levels.

Predictability enables leadership to make informed decisions, manage risk proactively, and align investment with outcomes.

## What Predictability Means (and Does Not Mean)

### Predictability Is
- Reliable delivery against planned commitments
- Stable flow of work across sprints and increments
- Transparent variance and early risk signaling
- Data-driven forecasting, not guesswork

### Predictability Is Not
- Hitting 100% of commitments every time
- Overcommitting to please stakeholders
- Freezing scope to protect dates
- Managing by optimism or anecdote

---

## Key Predictability Metrics

### Team-Level
- **Commitment Reliability**  
  Planned vs completed work per sprint (trend over time)
- **Velocity Stability**  
  Variance and trend, not absolute velocity
- **Cycle Time**  
  Time from work start to completion
- **Work in Progress (WIP)**  
  Controlled WIP correlates strongly with predictability

### Program-Level
- **PI Predictability Measure (SAFe)**  
  Business value planned vs achieved
- **Dependency Hit Rate**  
  Percentage of dependencies delivered as planned
- **Feature Throughput**  
  Features completed per PI

### Portfolio / Executive-Level
- **Forecast Accuracy**  
  Planned vs actual delivery dates and scope bands
- **Risk Aging**  
  How long known risks remain unresolved
- **Flow Distribution**  
  Allocation across new work, defects, enablers, and risk reduction

## Leading Indicators of Predictability

Predictability is driven by **early signals**, not end results.

- Backlog readiness quality (Definition of Ready adherence)
- Dependency visibility before commitment
- Stable team capacity assumptions
- Small batch sizing and vertical slicing
- Consistent estimation approach within teams
- Early escalation of risks and blockers

---

## Common Predictability Anti-Patterns

- Planning without capacity validation
- Ignoring dependencies until late in execution
- Re-planning mid-sprint due to external pressure
- Treating velocity as a performance metric
- Allowing unplanned work to bypass prioritization
- Large stories spanning multiple sprints

---

## Practices That Improve Predictability

### Planning Discipline
- Enforce Definition of Ready before commitment
- Plan to capacity, not desire
- Explicitly account for support, PTO, and unplanned work
- Identify and negotiate dependencies upfront

### Execution Discipline
- Limit WIP aggressively
- Track daily progress against sprint goals
- Address blockers within 24 hours
- Protect teams from scope churn

### Review & Inspect
- Review predictability trends, not single data points
- Inspect variance causes during retrospectives
- Adjust planning assumptions based on evidence

---

## Leadership Responsibilities

- Reward transparency, not optimism
- Accept trade-offs instead of demanding certainty
- Use ranges and confidence levels, not single dates
- Act on early risk signals
- Avoid mid-iteration priority changes

Predictability improves when leadership behavior reinforces **realism over heroics**.

---

## Success Indicators

- Stable delivery trends over multiple sprints and PIs
- Reduced last-minute scope cuts
- Fewer delivery surprises
- Higher stakeholder confidence in forecasts
- Teams able to say “no” with data

---

## Guiding Principle
**Predictability is a system outcome.**  
If delivery is unpredictable, fix the system — not the people.
