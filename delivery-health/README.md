# Delivery Health (Enterprise Delivery Signal)

Delivery Health provides a clear, objective view of how well teams and programs are executing against commitments. It enables early detection of risk, supports data-driven decision-making, and reinforces predictable delivery at scale.

---

## Purpose

To assess execution quality, flow stability, and delivery predictability across teams and programs, enabling leaders to intervene early and teams to continuously improve.

---

## Core Dimensions of Delivery Health

### 1. Predictability
Measures how reliably teams deliver against planned commitments.

**Signals**
- Sprint goal achievement rate
- Planned vs. completed work
- Commitment reliability trend over time

**Healthy State**
- Teams consistently meet sprint goals
- Variance is understood and explained
- Commitments are realistic and stable

---

### 2. Flow Efficiency
Evaluates how smoothly work moves through the system.

**Signals**
- Cycle time
- Lead time
- Work in Progress (WIP)
- Blocked work aging

**Healthy State**
- Stable or improving cycle time
- Controlled WIP
- Blockers resolved quickly

---

### 3. Quality
Ensures delivered work is usable, releasable, and sustainable.

**Signals**
- Defect leakage
- Escaped defects
- Rework rate
- Definition of Done adherence

**Healthy State**
- Low defect carryover
- Minimal rework
- Strong DoD compliance

---

### 4. Risk & Dependency Management
Assesses how proactively teams identify and manage delivery risks.

**Signals**
- Open dependencies
- Dependency aging
- Risk escalation timeliness
- Cross-team coordination effectiveness

**Healthy State**
- Dependencies identified early
- Risks escalated before impact
- Clear ownership and mitigation plans

---

### 5. Team Sustainability
Evaluates whether delivery pace is sustainable over time.

**Signals**
- Team capacity utilization
- Unplanned work percentage
- Overtime trends
- Team engagement indicators

**Healthy State**
- Balanced workload
- Minimal burnout signals
- Stable team velocity

---

## Delivery Health Review Cadence

- **Team Level:** Sprint Review / Retrospective
- **Program Level:** Weekly or bi-weekly execution sync
- **Leadership Level:** Monthly delivery health review

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Use trends, not single data points
- Focus on systemic issues, not individual performance
- Pair metrics with qualitative context
- Treat delivery health as a coaching signal, not a control mechanism

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Using delivery health as a performance rating
- Over-optimizing for one metric at the expense of others
- Reviewing metrics without action
- Delayed escalation of known risks

---

## Guiding Principle

Delivery health is about **learning and adaptation**, not judgment.  
Strong delivery health reflects disciplined execution, transparency, and continuous improvement.
